* Mastery
** Main Rule
*** You can be master only in a thing that you truly love doing.
*** It has to be something that does not tire you.
**** Because even if the pain is high, you have to do it.
**** Training, even if it is painful or dull is required.
** Paths
*** 1. Return to the origins

**** Know the dynamics
**** Do not show yourself, do not influence environment
***** Be quiet, observe
*** Apprenticeship (training)
**** Find your mentor and practice

*** Experimentation (active)
**** Now it is time to involve your personal strategies
**** All those small little tricks, internal knowledge, intuition is your key
